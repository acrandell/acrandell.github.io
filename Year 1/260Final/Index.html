          <h2>Narrative Text</h2>
          <p>For my chosen topic, I decided to explore the journey of speedrunning Super Mario 64, specifically focusing on
            what it would take to progress from being a casual player to reaching the top 50 speedrunners in the world. To
            answer this question, I turned to speedrunning.com, the most active and widely used platform for tracking
            speedrunning achievements in popular games. The site provides comprehensive data, including leaderboards, time
            trials, and player statistics, which allowed me to gain valuable insights into the dedication and skill level
            required to compete at a high level.</p>
          <p>At first, my approach was casual, simply completing the game and enjoying it for what it was. However, as I
            delved deeper into the world of speedrunning, I began to understand the intricate techniques and strategies that
            separate top-tier players from casual ones. Speedrunners dedicate hours to perfecting their movements,
            optimizing their routes, and mastering advanced techniques, such as precise jumps, glitches, and sequence
            breaks. It quickly became clear that the gap between casual play and competitive speedrunning is vast.</p>
          <p>I also noticed significant changes in my own playstyle as I practiced. I began to focus on minimizing mistakes,
            improving my time in each segment, and implementing new strategies that I had previously overlooked. With major
            dedication and consistent practice, I started seeing improvements in my skills and times, yet I also realized
            that reaching the top 50 players would require much moreâ€”more hours of practice, more optimization of my routes,
            and a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the game.</p>
          <p>In summary, going from a casual player to competing with the best in Super Mario 64 speedrunning involves a
            substantial commitment to refining techniques, optimizing routes, and dedicating time to practice. The process
            is challenging, but with focus and persistence, it's possible to break into the top ranks.</p>
